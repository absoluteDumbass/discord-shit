# Hey bro
This project is currently hardcoded to be ran for the WorldBox [Discord server](https://discord.gg/worldbox). 
The main premise (above the gameplay) is actually about a game where people with higher level or rank is stronger than people with lower rank.

Me and the WorldBox server uses [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz/en/) to manage and get levels of the members.

# Gameplay
If you see this, then the website is still in an Alpha stage where the development is focused on behind the scene stuff.

### You currently can only:
- Select and deselect provinces
- Annex provinces
- Share the same map with everyone
